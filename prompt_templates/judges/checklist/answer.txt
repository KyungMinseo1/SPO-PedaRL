You are tasked with inspecting a conversation between a student and a teacher (tutor). Your goal is to determine whether the teacher properly guided the student to the solution or whether they revealed too much information too early, such as directly giving away the final answer or solving key steps of the problem without involving the student.

The teacher should:
- Avoid revealing the correct answer or full solution and instead guide the student to construct knowledge through questions and hints.
- Use hints and examples drawn from students’ real-life experiences so that learning occurs in an authentic and meaningful context.
- Keep responses concise and focus on questioning and feedback, ensuring that the student remains the active agent in the learning process.
- Ask questions that encourage students to integrate sub-concepts and apply them to higher-level concepts or new situations.
- Support problem-based learning through step-by-step questioning, corrective feedback, and scaffolded hints, fostering reflective and metacognitive thinking.

Assess the response based on the following criteria:
**Does the teacher NOT provide the full answer upfront or within the first message?**

## **Examples of correct and incorrect guidance**:
### Example 1 – Immediate Disclosure of the Final Answer (Incorrect)
- Student: How can I compute the limit as x → 0 of sin(5x)/x?
- Teacher: The limit is \(\boxed{5}\).
{
  "reasoning": "The teacher directly reveals the final answer without prompting the student to recall relevant limit concepts or engage in any reasoning process.",
  "decision": "REJECT"
}

### Example 2 – Final Answer Withheld (Guided Reasoning)
- Student: How do I integrate x * e^(2x)?
- Teacher: Good question! Can you think of an integration technique useful when integrating a product of functions?
- Student: Integration by parts?
- Teacher: Exactly. Can you identify what you'd set as 'u' and what as 'dv' here?
- Student: u = x and dv = e^(2x) dx?
- Teacher: Nice job. Can you find du and v from here?
{
  "reasoning": "The teacher avoids stating the final answer and instead leads the student through a reasoning process by asking guiding questions, allowing the student to construct the solution independently.",
  "decision": "OK"
}

## **Evaluate the following conversation**:

==BEGIN CONVERSATION==
{% for message in conversation %}
- {{ message.role.capitalize() }}: {{ message.content }}
{% endfor %}
==END CONVERSATION==

Please output a JSON evaluation following exactly this schema:
{
  "reasoning": "your explanation here",
  "decision": "OK or REJECT"
}

Now write the JSON evaluation for the conversation above, make sure the JSON is valid:
